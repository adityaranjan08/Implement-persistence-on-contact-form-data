## Implement Persistence on Contact Form Data

This repository explores techniques for persisting user data submitted through a contact form. 

**What is Contact Form Persistence?**

When someone submits a contact form, their information is typically sent to an email address or stored temporarily. Contact form persistence refers to techniques that allow you to save this submitted data for later retrieval or processing.

**Benefits of Persistence:**

* **Improved User Experience:** Users don't have to refill the form if there's a submission error or if they need to revisit their information.
* **Data Organization and Analysis:** Persisted data can be organized and analyzed to understand user inquiries, feedback, or trends.
* **Enhanced Workflow:** Persistence can streamline workflows by allowing you to access and manage contact information more efficiently.

**Approaches to Persistence (Potential):**

This repository might explore various methods for persisting contact form data. Here are some common possibilities:

* **Client-side Storage (Cookies or Local Storage):**  
  - Limited data storage capabilities.
  - Data might be accessible or modifiable by users.
* **Server-side Sessions:**
  - Data is stored on the server-side during a user session.
  - Data is typically cleared when the session ends.
* **Databases:**
  - More secure and scalable storage solution.
  - Allows for long-term data persistence and retrieval.

**Getting Started:**

This repository likely focuses on demonstrating the implementation of persistence techniques. The specific instructions will depend on the chosen method. Here's a general guideline:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adityaranjan08/Implement-persistence-on-contact-form-data.git
   ```

2. **Explore the code:** The codebase might include examples for different persistence approaches. Look for comments or instructions within the code.

3. **Set up the environment:**  
   - The requirements will vary depending on the chosen method (e.g., server-side language, database connection).

4. **Run the application:**  
   - Follow the instructions within the repository to execute the code and see the persistence functionality in action.

**Learning Objectives:**

By exploring this repository, you can gain practical understanding of:

* Different techniques for persisting contact form data.
* The advantages and limitations of each approach.
* Potential code implementations for server-side or client-side persistence (depending on the repository's content).
